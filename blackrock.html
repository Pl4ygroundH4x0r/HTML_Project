<h1>Blackrock</h1>
<body>
<p>Blackrock is one of the 4 major reigions of the Inpherno, consisting of icy mountains, thriving technology and a lot of government! Yippee.</p>
<h2>A Closer Eye Into Blackrock's Division</h2>
<p>Blacrock mass produces robots called Biografts to make out certain tasks and the department is ran by Subspace T. Mine himself as head.</p>
<p>There's many types of them as well, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zeta Biografts (playable)</li>
    <li>Beta Biografts (skin)</li>
    <li>Chi Biografts</li>
    <li>Omega Biografts</li>
    <li>Epsilon Biografts (the most unknown by far)</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>All of these types of biografts are all in the link at the bottom</u></b></p>
<p>Blackrock is also quite a dangerous place if you don't tread carefully, especially at night when Midnight Crows take flight.</p>
<p><b>Midnight Crows are birds that's native to Blackrock that usally lurk at night and are hostile and intelligent but are able to be domesticated.</b></p>
