<h1>Lord Pwnatious "Moneybags" the III</h1>
<p>Lord Pwnatious is one of the Inphernals I will tell you about for the faction <a href="blackrock.html">Blackrock.</a> I would've done Subspace, but I think talking about him is more interesting.</p>

<h2>About Pwnatious</h2>
<p>Pwnatious is an extreme classist... (someone who favors their social class) and he <b>hates</b> inphernals who are poor. I am not kidding. And these are not my words but <a href="https://x.com/soda_stuff">SodaKettle</a> qoutes that he's a "nepotism baby and an asshole".</p>
<p>As expected, Pwnatious into a noble wealthy family of Blackrock and was taken cared of by Carnage (his personal robot) and a nanny.</p>
